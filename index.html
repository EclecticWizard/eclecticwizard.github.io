 <h1>Welcome</h1>
 <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
  <h3>About me</h3>
<p>I'm Jack. I have a strong interest in Cybersecurity and automating IT systems. <br />
  <br />

   I current work for Managed Service Provider in Kent. My role largely consists of providing general IT support and advice for clients as well as checking and, where possible, mitigating vulnerabilities with user accounts and managed devices. I'm also training towards an Intune specialisation for device and software management of client devices and user accounts. <br />
<br />
  In my previous employment, I created a "HR Portal" using Power Automate to streamline the process of staff members requesting time off and other activities; saving time and money. I also introduced Ansible to assist with the deployment and configuration of devices and software while learning Powershell scripting to help create an automation based approach to device management. <br />
<br />

I'm also studying towards a Computing and IT BSc with The Open University. My current module is the "Software Engineering" . Previously, I completed the Open University's module for "Cisco Networking (CCNA) 3 and DevNet" and "TM357 Systems Penetration Testing" which ties in very closely to the CEH - Certified Ethical Hacker Certification from the EC-Council. I've also completed modules centered around Java programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, Cybersecurity and CCNA parts 1 and 2 (Networking essentials as well as Switching and Routing).<br />
<br />
Outside of work I enjoy martial arts, running, reading and some light gaming. Occasionally I find the time to see some live music. Some of the bands I've seen recently include:
  <ul>
    <li>Mortiferum</li>
    <li>Sunn O)))</li>
    <li>Tangerine Dream</li>
    <li>Wolves in the Throne Room</li>
  </ul>
<br />
