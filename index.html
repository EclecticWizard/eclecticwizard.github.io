  <h3>About me</h3>
<p>I'm Jack. I have a strong interest in Cybersecurity and automating IT systems. <br />
  <br />
  I currently work as a 2nd Line Support Engineer for a secondary school in Kent, England. The role has allowed me to play around with various technologies. I introduced Ansible for deploying some applications to computer labs and automating a few tasks; Ansible operations are performed using a Vagrant box running Linux (Fedora atm) as all of the School's PCs run Windows. I have also created a SharePoint site for HR related activities which uses Microsoft Forms alongside Microsoft Flows/<a href="powerautomate.html">Power Automate</a> so that form details are forwared to the relevant people within the school (normally an individuals manager as listed on Active Directory), collect the response and inform the individual of the final outcome. This has been very successful and has sped up the process of things like booking holidays and reporting sickness as well as being a more sustainable alternative to printing out paper forms when needed. <br />
<br />

I've been studying towards a Computing and IT BSc with The Open University. My current module is "Systems Penetration Testing" which ties in very closely to the CEH - Certified Ethical Hacker certifiaction from the EC-Council. I've previously completed modules centered around Java programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, Cybersecurity and CCNA parts 1 and 2 (Networking essentials as well as Switching and Routing). I plan to continue with the Open University studying CCNA part 3 and Web, Mobile and Cloud Technologies.<br />
<br />
Outside of work I enjoy kickboxing (I've been training at a local club for 5+ years), running, reading and some light gaming. Occasionally I find the time to see some live music. Some of the bands I've seen recently include:
  <ul>
    <li>Mortiferum</li>
    <li>Sunn O)))</li>
    <li>Tangerine Dream</li>
    <li>Wolves in the Throne Room</li>
  </ul>
